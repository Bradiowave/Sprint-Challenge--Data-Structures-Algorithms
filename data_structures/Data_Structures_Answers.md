Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? -- O(n)

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? -- O(log n) //actually O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? -- O(n)

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method? -- O(n) //actually O(leaves)

5. What is the runtime complexity of your `heapsort` function? -- O(log n) //mine is actually O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the `heapsort` function? Recall that your implementation should return a new array with the sorted data. What would be the space complexity if your function instead altered the input array? -- The current space complexity is O(2n). If the function altered the input array the space complexity would be O(n). With Big O however, O(2n) is the same as O(n)
